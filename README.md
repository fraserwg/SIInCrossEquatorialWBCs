# Symmetric instability in cross-equatorial western boundary currents
This repository contains code used in Goldsworth et al. (2021) to investigate symmetric instability in cross-equatorial flows. This repository contains three folers:
- `LinearStabilityAnalysis`, containing a jupyter notebook used in performing a linear stability analysis
- `2DModels`, containing MITgcm configuration files for a suite of two dimensional models
- `3DModels`, containing MITgcm configuration files for a suite of three dimensional models

Each of these sets of experiments is discussed at length in the paper. Contained within each subfolder is a readme with details on how to get started with running the jupyter notebook and setting up the MITgcm model with the provided configuration files.

The linear stability analysis can also be run in binder by clicking the binder icon at the top of this file.
