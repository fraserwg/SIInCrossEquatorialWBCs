# Symmetric instability in cross-equatorial western boundary currents
This repository contains code used in Goldsworth et al. (2021) to investigate symmetric instability in cross-equatorial flows. This repository contains three folers:
- `LinearStabilityAnalysis`, containing a jupyter notebook used in performing a linear stability analysis
- `2DModels`, containing MITgcm configuration files for a suite of two dimensional models
- `3DModels`, containing MITgcm configuration files for a suite of three dimensional models

Each of these sets of experiments is discussed at length in the paper. Contained within each subfolder is a readme with details on how to get started with running the jupyter notebook and setting up the MITgcm model with the provided configuration files.
