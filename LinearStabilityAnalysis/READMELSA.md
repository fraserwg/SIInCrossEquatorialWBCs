# The linear stability analysis
This folder contains the jupyter notebook used to perform the linear stability analysis -- `LinearStabilityAnalysis.ipynb`. The root directory of this repository also contains an `environment.yml` file which details the package versions needed to run the notebook. For help in getting started with jupter notebooks see https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.

The notebook can also be run by clicking on the binder icon at the top of this file which will open the notebook on the cloud. If doing this you may want to reduce the horizontal resolution used by the numerical solver to reduce the computation times.
